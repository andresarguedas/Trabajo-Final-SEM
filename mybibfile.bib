Similar but more powerful than regression analyses, it examines linear causal relationships among variables, while simultaneously accounting for measurement error. The purpose of the present paper is to explicate SEM to medical and health sciences researchers and exemplify their application. Findings. To facilitate its use we provide a series of steps for applying SEM to research problems. We then present three examples of how SEM has been utilized in medical and health sciences research. Conclusion. When many considerations are given to research planning, SEM can provide a new perspective on analyzing data and potential for advancing research in medical and health sciences. {\textcopyright} 2010 Beran et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

  abstract = {With the use of census block group data on sociodemographics, land use, and travel behavior, the cutoffs suggested in the literature for trustworthy estimates and hypothesis-testing statistics were tested, and the efficacy of deleting observations as an approach to improving multivariate normality in structural equation modeling was evaluated. It was found that the deletion of enough cases to achieve multivariate normality yielded results that were substantively different from those for the full sample and required that 17{\%} of the sample be discarded. Alternatively, after only a few true outliers were deleted (0.8{\%} of the sample), the measures of univariate and multivariate nonnormalities fell into the acceptable range for maximum likelihood estimation to be appropriate. The pursuit of a multivariate normal distribution by the deletion of observations should be consciously weighed against the loss of model power and generalizability in the interpretation of the results. That is, the analyst should proactively find the balance between the two extremes of (a) a model on the full sample that is unreliable because of extreme nonnormality and (p) a model on a sample that has discarded so many cases to achieve multivariate normality that it is no longer fully representative of the desired population. It is further argued that the process of finding that balance should be exposed to the audience rather than ignored or suppressed.},

Using a 2-index presentation strategy, which includes using the maximum likelihood (ML)-based standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR) and supplementing it with either Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), Bollen's (1989) Fit Index (BL89), Relative Noncentrality Index (RNI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Gamma Hat, Mc- Donald's Centrality Index (Mc), or root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA), various combinations of cutoff values from selected ranges of cutoff criteria for the ML-based SRMR and a given supplemental fit index were used to calculate rejection rates for various types of true-population and misspecified models; that is, models with misspecified factor covariance(s) and models with misspecified factor loading(s). The results suggest that, for the ML method, a cutoff value close to .95 for TLI, BL89, CFI, RNI, and Gamma Hat; a cutoff value close to .90 for Mc; a cutoff value close to .08 for SRMR; and a cutoff value close to .06 for RMSEA are needed before we can conclude that there is a relatively good fit between the hypothesized model and the observed data. Furthermore, the 2-index presentation strategy is required to reject reasonable proportions of various types of true-population and misspecified models. Finally, using the proposed cutoff criteria, the ML-based TLI, Mc, and RMSEA tend to overreject true-population models at small sample size and thus are less preferable when sample size is small. {\textcopyright} 1999, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.},

  abstract = {Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a tool for analyzing multivariate data that has been long known in marketing to be especially appropriate for theory testing (e.g., Bagozzi, 1980). In this chapter, we introduce the basic ideas of SEM using a data set collected to test the theory of planned behavior (TPB; Ajzen, 1991). TPB is an extension of the earlier theory of reasoned action (Fishbein {\&} Ajzen, 1975), and both attempt to address the often observed discrepancy between attitude and behavior. In our example, we use the theory to understand predictors of dieting behavior. The data were collected from a sample of 108 college students who had the goal of reducing or maintaining their current body weight. Participants' attitudes toward dieting were examined using 11 semantic differential items, of which 6 were designed to tap the more cognitive aspect of the attitude (e.g., useless-useful), and 5 were designed to tap the more affective aspect of the attitude (e.g., unenjoyable- enjoyable). A self-report measure of behavior was obtained a few weeks later by recontacting participants. Next, we discuss some of the more advanced topics in SEM. Do's and don'ts of SEM are then presented.

Normal theory GLS and the recently developed ADF estimator are compared for six cases of non‐normality, two sample sizes, and four models of increasing size in a Monte Carlo framework with a large number of replications. Results show that GLS and ADF chi‐square tests are increasingly sensitive to non‐normality when the size of the model increases. No parameter estimate bias was observed for GLS and only slight parameter bias was found for ADF. A downward bias in estimated standard errors was found for GLS which remains constant across model size. For ADF, a downward bias in estimated standard errors was also found which became increasingly worse with the size of the model. 1992 The British Psychological Society},

It is, therefore, a brief overview of SEM and presents its beginnings, historical development, its usefulness in the social sciences and the statistical and philosophical (theoretical) controversies which have often appeared in the literature pertaining to SEM. Having described the essence of SEM in the context of causal analysis, the author discusses the years of the development of structural modeling as the consequence of many researchers' systematically growing needs (in particular in the social sciences) who strove to effectively understand the structure and interactions of latent phenomena. The early beginnings of SEM models were related to the work of Spearman and Wright, and to that of other prominent researchers who contributed to SEM development. The importance and predominance of theoretical assumptions over technical issues for the successful construction of SEM models are also described. Then, controversies regarding the use of SEM in the social sciences are presented. Finally, the opportunities and threats of this type of analytical strategy as well as selected areas of SEM applications in the social sciences are discussed.},
